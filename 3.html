            target="_blank" title="HTML5">JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a <strong><u>programming language and core technology</u> of the World Wide Web</strong>, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
